  %p
    this page doesn't auto-refresh to check for new emails, so you're gonna have to do that by hand to see if new ones came in.

  %p
    if you don't wanna keep checking back by hand, you can always use that little RSS feed link up there and add it to your reader or smart links or whatever

  %p
    if you hit the back button on your browser you are going to be given a new disposable email address, so I wouldn't do that unless you don't care or have already bookmarked this page or used the RSS magic
